=x , put 'x' in cell of data pointer. (when the program starts, the data pointer is on c1)
>  , increase data pointer
<  , decrease data pointer                             
-  , decrease data on the data pointer with one
+x  , increment data on the data pointer with one
{  , open loop, if data on the loop pointer
}  , close/end loop
o  , output data at the data pointer
n  , a newline;'\n'
?(expressie)  , 



 #  shift cells. (if the data pointer is curently in c1, the pointer increments. if the data pointer is currently in c2, the pointer decrements)
<  , decrease
+  , add c1 and c2 in the cell of the data pointer.
-  , minus the values of c1 and c2. (if you're in c1, the value in c2 gets decreased in your cell. c1=4, c2=5;data pointer = 2. in this case minus means: 5-4 = 1, after: c1 = 4, c2 = 1)
